# Form validation 3

In this final task, I'm provided with a similar example to what I saw in the accompanying article â€” an email address entry input. I need to use the constraint validation API, plus some form validation attributes, to program some custom error messages.

- I must make the input mandatory to fill in and give it a minimum length of 10 characters.
- I should add an event listener that checks whether the inputted value is an email address and whether it is long enough. If it doesn't look like an email address or is too short, I need to provide the user with appropriate custom error messages.
