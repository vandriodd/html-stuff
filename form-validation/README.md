# Form validation 1

In this task, which is from the MDN Web Docs article "Test your skills: Form validation", I'm working with a simple support query form. My goal is to enhance it with the following validation features:

- Make all input fields mandatory before the form can be submitted.
- Modify the "Email address" and "Phone number" field types to enable more specific browser validation for the expected data.
- Enforce a required length of 5 to 20 characters for the "User name" field, a maximum length of 15 characters for the "Phone number" field, and a maximum length of 200 characters for the "Comment" field.
